# Text_Encripter
This is simple program written in C# and using GTK for the gui that let you open and save files and also has the option to "encript" them with a personal key.
 
 For some reason GitHUb doesnt let me upload anything except .zip files so I had to do so.
 You can find a .exe file in the bin/Debug
