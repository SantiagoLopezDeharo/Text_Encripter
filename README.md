# Text_Encripter
This is simple program written in C# and using GTK for the gui that let you open and save files and also has the option to "encript" them with a personal key.
I hope you find this project intresting. 
 You can find a .exe file in the bin/Debug that runs as much in windows as in linux and mac os.
